# Data-Structures
In this repository, I have added all the data structures and algorithms programs I have made during practice of them in python programming language.
Currently, I have added programs of following topics after learning and practising them from various sources:

- Stack
- Queue
- Recursion
- LinkedList
- Dynamic Programming
- Dequeue
- Graph

I have referred sources like GeeksforGeeks, Educative.io, RuneStone Academy, Youtube and some more for getting good with them
